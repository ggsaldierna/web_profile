            Here, I have provided a couple example of programs I have developed. The links below will direct the user to a game that
            I have created using Unity which were written mainly in C# and C++. For full experience, fullscreen the game once it has loaded.

            The video below is about an Android application I helped create. The video shows the app being used in real-time;
            however, the app was discontinued due to not being able to keep the payments of the app's servers. <br /> <br />
